# ComboListEater
Accepts ComboLists, prompts for delimiter. 


!!Run ```pip install ZStandard``` in IDE terminal!!

Accepts large .txt and .zst files and converts them to a .db file with a variable, user-set delimiter and number of columns. 

Not very exciting but a nice sister project to PasswordEater.
